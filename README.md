This project was part of my coursework for a computer vision course taught by Davi Geiger at NYU. The link to the assignment can be found at http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring17/CSCI-UA.0480-001/

This program will detect the edges in an image and display the Morlet wavelets, the convolutions between the image and the wavelets, the max real/imaginary value images for the convolutions, and the edges.

To run this program:
python &lt;filepath&gt; &lt;imagepath&gt;
